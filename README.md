# IncludeGraphGen

This program attempts to generate an include graph using MSAGL from a CMakeLists.txt.
The project has to be in C++.

It is very WIP and is not guaranteed to work 100% of the time, it relies a lot on text parsing so it may not be perfect.
It was just a little project done in my spare time to help me with some include-hell debugging.

PRs and issues welcome.
